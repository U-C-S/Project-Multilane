# Project-MultiLane

This project is a simulation of a multi-lane highway. Currently, It's in very early stages of Prototyping. I intend to use this project to learn and create a simualation model and also, develop a visualization for the Model.

<!-- The simulation is based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. The model is implemented in Python and the simulation is visualized using Pygame. -->
